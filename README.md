<h1>A Crowdfunding Smart Contract</h1> 

This is the repo for my first smart contract setup and deployment. It's only a test contract so no real crypto was used. However it shows the basics of setting up a smart contract and seeing it deployed on a test net blockchain.

<h2>Setting Up Our Workspace and IDE </h2>
We will be using Remix Ethereum IDE for this project.

First lets delete the files in the workspace and start from scratch.

Let's create a file a call it SimpleStorage.sol.
<br/>

```
Create > New File > SimpleStorage.sol
```

This file ends in .sol which indicates to the compiler that it is a solidity file.

Let's have a look at the side menu icons.

The magnifying glass searchs for anything you search for and outputs where it is located and in which contract it is located.
